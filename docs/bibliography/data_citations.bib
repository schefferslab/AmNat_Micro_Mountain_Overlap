	abstract = {Biodiversity is spatially organized by climatic gradients across elevation and latitude. But do other gradients exist that might drive biogeographic patterns? Here, we show that rainforest's vertical strata provide climatic gradients much steeper than those offered by elevation and latitude, and biodiversity of arboreal species is organized along this gradient. In Philippine and Singaporean rainforests, we demonstrate that rainforest frogs tend to shift up in the rainforest strata as altitude increases. Moreover, a Philippine-wide dataset of frog distributions shows that frog assemblages become increasingly arboreal at higher elevations. Thus, increased arboreality with elevation at broad biogeographic scales mirrors patterns we observed at local scales. Our proposed ‘arboreality hypothesis’ suggests that the ability to exploit arboreal habitats confers the potential for larger geographical distributions because species can shift their location in the rainforest strata to compensate for shifts in temperature associated with elevation and latitude. This novel finding may help explain patterns of species richness and abundance wherever vegetation produces a vertical microclimatic gradient. Our results further suggest that global warming will ‘flatten’ the biodiversity in rainforests by pushing arboreal species towards the cooler and wetter ground. This ‘flattening’ could potentially have serious impacts on forest functioning and species survival.},

	abstract = {Fire is currently perceived as a major threat to ecosystems and biodiversity in the mountains of the Mediterranean region. Portugal's highest mountain range, the Serra da Estrela, is one of the country's most important protected areas and also the most fire-prone. We present a ∼14,000-year fire history based on microscopic charred particles in an infilled glacial lake to better understand the antiquity of biomass burning and its effects on Mediterranean vegetation at the Atlantic margin. Results indicate the continuous occurrence of fire in the Serra da Estrela over the period of the record. Two periods of increased fire activity – around 12,000–11,000 calendar years before the present (cal. a BP) and 3500–2500 cal. a BP – were accompanied by major vegetation changes and followed by long periods of vegetation stabilisation. Cross-correlation analyses reveal that post-fire succession consistently began with herbaceous vegetation, followed by forest and shrubland stages. Past successional trends were often markedly different to those observed at present. Holocene climatic changes, including shifts in the North Atlantic Oscillation, played a pivotal role in the vegetation development and fire history of the Serra da Estrela. In the late Holocene, human use of fire became a major agent of vegetation change, accelerating the Holocene decline of forests.},

	abstract = {While commonplace in other parts of the world, long-term and ongoing observations of the phenology of native tree species are rare in North America. We use 14 years of field survey data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to fit simple models of canopy phenology for three northern hardwood species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). These models are then run with historical meteorological data to investigate potential climate change effects on phenology. Development and senescence are quantified using an index that ranges from 0 (dormant, no leaves) to 4 (full, green canopy). Sugar maple is the first species to leaf out in the spring, whereas American beech is the last species to drop its leaves in the fall. Across an elevational range from 250 to 825 m ASL, the onset of spring is delayed by 2.7±0.4 days for every 100 m increase in elevation, which is in reasonable agreement with Hopkin's law. More than 90\% of the variation in spring canopy development, and just slightly less than 90\% of the variation in autumn canopy senescence, is accounted for by a logistic model based on accumulated degree-days. However, degree-day based models fit to Hubbard Brook data appear to overestimate the rate at which spring development occurs at the more southerly Harvard Forest. Autumn senescence at the Harvard Forest can be predicted with reasonable accuracy in sugar maple but not American beech. Retrospective modeling using five decades (1957–2004) of Hubbard Brook daily mean temperature data suggests significant trends (P≤0.05) towards an earlier spring (e.g. sugar maple, rate of change=0.18 days earlier/yr), consistent with other studies documenting measurable climate change effects on the onset of spring in both North America and Europe. Our results also suggest that green canopy duration has increased by about 10 days (e.g. sugar maple, rate of change=0.21 days longer/yr) over the period of study.},

	abstract = {Given the dramatic loss of tropical forests and accelerating climate change, secondary forest regeneration is increasingly recognised as being an important method for reversing losses in biodiversity and carbon stocks. The recolonisation of biodiversity within secondary forests depends in part upon the recovery of forest structure, including the range of microhabitats used by diverse local communities. Here, we investigate the return of critical microhabitats along a successional gradient of secondary forest in the Tropical Andes of Colombia. We measured the abundance of live (bromeliads, tree ferns and moss) and dead (deadwood and leaf litter) microhabitats across three landscapes, each encompassing primary, and young (4–18yr old) and old secondary forests (19–35yr old). Considering the increasing rate of climate warming in the region, we also explored whether these microhabitats provide thermally buffered microclimates. We found that secondary forests have different composition and lower complexity of microhabitats than primary forests, but microhabitats appear to be recovering towards primary forest levels. Furthermore, in all forest types, microhabitats had lower maximum temperatures and higher minimum temperatures, thereby serving as thermal buffers that reduced exposure to extreme temperatures. These benefits exist despite ambient temperatures in secondary forests surpassing those of primary forests by 1–2°C on average. The protection of secondary forest and promotion of further forest regrowth in the Tropical Andes should represent an urgent investment for conservation, and the value of these forests for offering critical microhabitats and buffered microclimates under climate change should not be overlooked.},

	abstract = {Temperature is a core component of a species' fundamental niche. At the fine scale over which most organisms experience climate (mm to ha), temperature depends upon the amount of radiation reaching the Earth's surface, which is principally governed by vegetation. Tropical regions have undergone widespread and extreme changes to vegetation, particularly through the degradation and conversion of rainforests. As most terrestrial biodiversity is in the tropics, and many of these species possess narrow thermal limits, it is important to identify local thermal impacts of rainforest degradation and conversion. We collected pantropical, site-level ({\textless}1 ha) temperature data from the literature to quantify impacts of land-use change on local temperatures, and to examine whether this relationship differed aboveground relative to belowground and between wet and dry seasons. We found that local temperature in our sample sites was higher than primary forest in all human-impacted land-use types (N = 113,894 daytime temperature measurements from 25 studies). Warming was pronounced following conversion of forest to agricultural land (minimum +1.6°C, maximum +13.6°C), but minimal and nonsignificant when compared to forest degradation (e.g., by selective logging; minimum +1°C, maximum +1.1°C). The effect was buffered belowground (minimum buffering 0°C, maximum buffering 11.4°C), whereas seasonality had minimal impact (maximum buffering 1.9°C). We conclude that forest-dependent species that persist following conversion of rainforest have experienced substantial local warming. Deforestation pushes these species closer to their thermal limits, making it more likely that compounding effects of future perturbations, such as severe droughts and global warming, will exceed species' tolerances. By contrast, degraded forests and belowground habitats may provide important refugia for thermally restricted species in landscapes dominated by agricultural land.},

The data are from the Imnavait Creek and Toolik Lake regions. We focus on associations of dry and mesic upland surfaces and moderate snow accumulation sites; other upland plant communities, i.e. those of blockfields, non-sorted circles, and water tracks, are briefly described. Summary floristic information is presented in a synoptic table. Five associations and 15 community types are tentatively placed into seven existing syntaxonomical classes. The community descriptions are arranged according to habitat: dry exposed acidic sites, moist acidic shallow snowbeds, moist non-acidic snowbeds, moist acidic uplands, and moist non-acidic uplands. Many of the communities are Beringian vicariants of associations previously described from Greenland and the European Arctic. The described communities have a widespread distribution in northern Alaska.

	abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {Data from spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) opens the possibility to map forest vertical structure globally. We present a wall-to-wall, global map of canopy height at 1-km spatial resolution, using 2005 data from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite). A challenge in the use of GLAS data for global vegetation studies is the sparse coverage of lidar shots (mean = 121 data points/degree2 for the L3C campaign). However, GLAS-derived canopy height (RH100) values were highly correlated with other, more spatially dense, ancillary variables available globally, which allowed us to model global RH100 from forest type, tree cover, elevation, and climatology maps. The difference between the model predicted RH100 and footprint level lidar-derived RH100 values showed that error increased in closed broadleaved forests such as the Amazon, underscoring the challenges in mapping tall ({\textgreater}40 m) canopies. The resulting map was validated with field measurements from 66 FLUXNET sites. The modeled RH100 versus in situ canopy height error (RMSE = 6.1 m, R2 = 0.5; or, RMSE = 4.4 m, R2 = 0.7 without 7 outliers) is conservative as it also includes measurement uncertainty and sub pixel variability within the 1-km pixels. Our results were compared against a recently published canopy height map. We found our values to be in general taller and more strongly correlated with FLUXNET data. Our map reveals a global latitudinal gradient in canopy height, increasing towards the equator, as well as coarse forest disturbance patterns.},

	abstract = {Beta diversity patterns along elevational gradients have become a hot topic in the study of biogeography and can help illuminate the processes structuring mountain ecosystems. Although elevational species richness patterns have been well documented, there remains much uncertainty over the causes of beta diversity patterns across elevational gradients. We conducted bird surveys and obtained high-resolution climatic data along an elevational gradient in Gyirong Valley in the central Himalayas, China, between 1,800 and 5,400 m elevation. In total, we recorded 182 bird species (including 169 breeding birds). We simulated beta diversity patterns with the mid-domain effect (MDE) null model and conducted distance-based redundancy analyses (db-RDA) to relate beta diversity to dispersal limitations, spatial constraints, habitat complexity, contemporary climate, and historical climate. Mantel tests and variation partitioning were employed to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations of environmental factors with beta diversity. Patterns of empirical and simulated beta diversity were both hump-shaped, peaking at intermediate elevations. The db-RDA indicated that beta diversity was correlated with changes in spatially structured environmental factors, especially with contemporary climate and habitat complexity. Mantel tests and variation partitioning also suggested that climate dissimilarity was the major independent correlate of beta diversity. The random community structure and spatial constraints may also contribute to the overall hump-shaped pattern. Beta diversity of bird communities in Gyirong Valley could be explained by the combination of different factors but is mainly shaped by the spatially structured environmental factors, especially contemporary climate.},

	abstract = {Aim We map estimated historical population declines resulting from species-specific models of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for three forest-dependent chameleons. Location East Usambara Mountains, Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania. Methods We surveyed three chameleon species (Rhampholeon spinosus, Rhampholeon temporalis and Trioceros deremensis) along 32.2 km of transects and used a hierarchical, distance-sampling model to estimate densities. The model included habitat characteristics at the landscape (patch) and local (transect) scales while accounting for detectability. By analysing the model in a Bayesian framework, we were able to propagate error through the entire analysis and obtain exact solutions despite small sample sizes. We then used our estimated relationships between habitat and density to project chameleon population sizes across current and historical land cover maps of the study area (230 km2), giving an estimate of the impact of anthropogenic habitat alteration on these species. Results Species’ densities increased in larger patches and further from patch edges and varied seasonally. Local vegetation characteristics had significant relationships with expected chameleon densities, though effect sizes were small. Estimates of total current population sizes varied by two orders of magnitude among species, but each was 49–79\% higher than detection-naïve estimates. All three declined from estimated historical levels by approximately 60\% in the study area, approximately one-third more than would be expected from forest loss alone. Remaining populations of the study species are predominantly located in protected nature reserves, so the future of these species will likely be determined by the degree of protection offered by the nature reserves. Main conclusions Habitat loss and fragmentation have greatly reduced forest-dependent chameleon population sizes in the East Usambara Mountains. Populations of these species in other areas are experiencing higher rates of habitat loss. Efforts aimed at ensuring the efficacy of protected forests may be a key to conserving remaining populations.},

	abstract = {Differences in water and carbon fluxes along a climate/elevation gradient within a sagebrush ecosystem are quantified, and inferences are made about climate warming using a network of eddy covariance systems. Sites are located within the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory in southwestern Idaho, USA, with elevations ranging from 1425 to 2111 m, annual precipitation ranging from 290 to 795 mm and annual temperature ranging from 9.1 to 5.4 °C. Annual gross ecosystem production (GEP) for the sites averaged (± uncertainty) 385 ± 6, 549 ± 19, 684 ± 25, and 818 ± 26 gC m−2 from lowest to highest elevation. Annual net ecosystem production indicated that the sites are carbon sinks with annual uptake typically ranging from 100 ± 10 to 200 ± 30 gC m−2. Exceptions to this are: the lowest elevation site which was carbon neutral (1 ± 16 gC m−2) during a year with a summer rainfall respiration pulse, and the highest elevation site, where carbon uptake dropped to 42 ± 20 gC m−2 during a heavy snow year. Carbon flux and evapotranspiration (ET) peaked about a month earlier at the lower elevation sites, but with limited precipitation, these sites encountered water stress for much of the growing season. Model simulations suggest that climate warming will likely have a negligible impact on annual ET and GEP at lower elevations, but rather shift ET and GEP earlier in the season and prolong the period of water stress. ET and GEP may increase with climate warming at higher elevations where precipitation is above a threshold of about 450 mm.},

	abstract = {An extension of the climate variability hypothesis is that relatively stable climate, such as that of the tropics, induces distinct thermal bands across elevation that render dispersal over tropical mountains difficult compared to temperate mountains. Yet, ecosystems are not thermally static in space-time, especially at small scales, which might render some mountains greater thermal isolators than others. Here, we provide an extensive investigation of temperature drivers from fine to coarse scales, and demonstrate that the degree of overlap in temperatures at high and low elevations on mountains is driven by more than just absolute mountain height and latitude. We compiled a database of 29 mountains spanning 6 continents to characterize “thermal overlap” by vertically stratified microhabitats, biomes, and owing to seasonal changes in foliage, demonstrating via mixed-effects modeling that micro- and mesogeography more strongly influence thermal overlap than macrogeography. Impressively, an increase of one meter of vertical microhabitat height generates an increase in overlap equivalent to a 5.26° change in latitude. In addition, forested mountains have reduced overlap – 149\% lower – relative to non-forested mountains. We provide evidence in support of a climate hypothesis that emphasizes microgeography as a determinant of dispersal, demographics, and behavior, thereby refining classical theory of macroclimate variability as a prominent driver of biogeography.},

	abstract = {Temperature is a core component of a species’ fundamental niche. At the fine scale over which most organisms experience climate (mm to ha), temperature depends upon the amount of radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, which is principally governed by vegetation. Tropical regions have undergone widespread and extreme changes to vegetation, particularly through the degradation and conversion of rainforests. Since most terrestrial biodiversity is in the tropics, and many of these species possess narrow thermal limits, it is important to identify local thermal impacts of rainforest degradation and conversion. We collected pan-tropical, site-level (\&lt; 1 ha) temperature data from the literature to quantify impacts of land-use change on local temperatures, and to examine whether this relationship differed above-ground relative to below-ground and between wet and dry seasons. We found that local temperature in our sample sites was higher than primary forest in all human-impacted land-use types (N = 113,894 day-time temperature measurements from 25 studies). Warming was pronounced following conversion of forest to agricultural land (minimum +1.6°C, maximum +13.6°C), but minimal and non-significant when compared to forest degradation (e.g. by selective logging; minimum +1°C, maximum +1.1°C). The effect was buffered below-ground (minimum buffering 0°C, maximum buffering 11.4°C), whereas seasonality had minimal impact (maximum buffering 1.9°C). We conclude that forest-dependent species that persist following conversion of rainforest have experienced substantial local warming. Deforestation pushes these species closer to their thermal limits, making it more likely that compounding effects of future perturbations, such as severe droughts and global warming, will exceed species’ tolerances. By contrast, degraded forests and below-ground habitats may provide important refugia for thermally-restricted species in landscapes dominated by agricultural land.},

	abstract = {Aim Documenting the elevational species richness patterns of non-volant small mammals and assessing the roles of pure spatial factors and spatial structured environmental factors in shaping the elevational richness patterns. Location Gyirong Valley in the Mount Qomolangma National Nature Reserve, located in the southern Himalayas, China. Methods Field surveys were conducted at each of twelve 300-m elevational bands along a gradient from 1,800 to 5,400 m above sea level (a.s.l). For the pure spatial variables, we calculated area and the spatial null model named MDE (cf. below). For spatial structured environmental variables, we calculated mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature range, potential evapotranspiration (PET), the normalized difference vegetation index, plant species richness and habitat heterogeneity. Multivariate models of species richness against eight factors (excluding PET) for different species groups were used to test the explanatory power of both the spatial structured environmental variables and the pure spatial variables. In addition, mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were used to test the water–energy dynamics model for each species groups. Results Seven hundred and fifty-five individuals of 22 species were documented over 21,600 trap nights. The elevational species richness pattern for all non-volant small mammals was hump-shaped with the highest richness occurring at 2,700–3,300 m a.s.l. Endemic and non-endemic species as well as two elevational range size categories of small mammals also generally showed hump-shaped species richness patterns. In most data sets, spatial structured environmental variables played more important roles than the pure spatial variables in shaping the elevational species richness patterns than the pure spatial factors, while the MDE contributed to richness patterns for large-ranged species. The water–energy dynamics model explained 66\% of the variation in all the non-volant small mammals, 56\% for endemic species, 88\% for the non-endemic species, 59\% for the large-ranged species, and 53\% for the small-ranged species. Main conclusions Although no single key factor can explain all species richness patterns, we found that spatial structured environmental variables correlate well with the elevational species richness pattern of non-volant small mammals. The water–energy dynamics model was found to explain non-volant small mammal species richness along the Gyirong Valley.},
